# XRCCVC E-Book Library

## Project Overivew
Currently the XRCVC (Xaviers Resource Center for the Visually Challenged) does not have its own system to manage their books and library. Our purpose of this project is to design and develop an e-library system for the XRCVC.

The XRCVC e-Library System project aims to design and develop a comprehensive and user-friendly digital library system for XRCVC. The project seeks to replace the current manual system of managing books with an automated system that will help both students and staff to easily manage and retrieve information about the books available in the library.

As the name suggests, the e-Library System project has been developed as an online digital library to store the information about books in the library electronically. Users would be able to request books from the XRCVC and download accessible books directly from Sugamya Pustakalaya. Along with the online website, an Android App has been developed for quick access to the library from the mobile phones.

The primary benefit of the e-Library System is that it will reduce manual work to a great extent and streamline library activities. Students will be able to search for and request books online, while staff members will be able to manage book requests and update the library catalogue in real-time. This will significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the library operations.

## Key Features
Some of the key features of the platform include:

- A comprehensive database of available books with information on authors, publishers, ISBN, formats, and language.
- A search system for the e-library that allows users to quickly find the books they need.
- An easy-to-use administration system that allows the XRCVC staff to add, update, and delete information in the system as needed.
- Elimination of the need for users to download an Excel spreadsheet to view the book list.
- Real-time updates of the library catalogue, ensuring that users always have access to the most up-to-date information.
- An automated system for new book requests that eliminates the need for users to send emails to the XRCVC.
- The ability for users to download accessible books from the National Library for persons with disabilities, Sugamya Pustakalaya.
 
By implementing these features, the new platform would significantly reduce the inconvenience and delay experienced by students seeking accessible books. Users would be able to search and request books online, and the real-time updates would ensure that they always have access to the latest information. Overall, the new platform would provide a more efficient, user-friendly, and accessible experience for students with disabilities who rely on XRCVCâ€™s library services.
